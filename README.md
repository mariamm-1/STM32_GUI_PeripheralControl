# STM32 GUI Peripheral Control Project

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed during my internship at **ITI** under the supervision of *[Instructor’s Name]* and *[Assistant’s Name]*.  
It demonstrates **hardware-software integration** using an **STM32 microcontroller**, combining GUI interaction with hardware peripherals through communication protocols.

## 🎯 Features
- 🖥️ **GUI Control via UART** – PC GUI sends commands to the STM32 for hardware control.  
- 📺 **TFT Display via SPI** – Displays images efficiently using SPI communication.  
- 🔤 **LED Matrix** – Scrolls text dynamically across the matrix.  
- 🔊 **Sound Control Simulation** – Audio activity simulated using LED patterns.  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- **Microcontroller:** STM32 (ARM Cortex-M)  
- **Protocols:** UART, SPI  
- **IDE:** STM32CubeIDE  
- **Configuration Tool:** STM32CubeMX  
- **Peripherals:** TFT display, LED matrix  

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The **GUI** communicates with the STM32 over **UART**.  
2. The **STM32** processes commands and updates peripherals:  
   - TFT screen (via SPI)  
   - LED matrix (scrolling text)  
   - LED-based sound simulation  
3. The result is an **interactive embedded system** controlled seamlessly from a GUI.

## 📖 Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with **UART & SPI communication**.  
- Strengthened understanding of **embedded systems design**.  
- Practiced **hardware-software integration** in real time.
